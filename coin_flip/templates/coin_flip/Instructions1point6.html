    <h2>Welcome to the Study! Please read the following instructions carefully. </h2>

        <p>
        Each coin is "worth" $1. If you guessed correctly in the second question of a subround, you will receive $2, $1 for guessing each coin correctly. If not, you will receive $0. You <b>must guess the outcome of both coins correctly to receive the payment.</b> Guessing only one of the two coins correctly is not enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will not see whether you won or not immediately. Your earnings will be revealed only at the end of the 10 rounds.
        </p>
